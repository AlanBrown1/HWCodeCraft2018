Here's the address for the contest: http://codecraft.devcloud.huaweicloud.com/home/GeneralIntro

Three sdks are availabe, python, java and c++. We use python.

## Task Anlysis
For this year's contest, it actually can be divided into two parts, any of them can be logically separated, which means that that can be treated individually.

For the first part, it can be regarded as a ML task. Due to the competition restriction, competitors can not use any third-part libraries, so we just use Gray Model.

For the second part, it's a NP hard problem, which can be regarded as a packing problem in two dimensions. We realized the algrithm as mentioned in the doc above.
